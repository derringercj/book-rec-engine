# book-rec-engine

This program implements a modern and up-to-date book recommendation engine. Algorithms such as those hosted on Goodreads are ineffective and don't leverage the updated technology that helps analyze semantic similarity efficiently. The goal is for the user to input their favorite book, or a book that they want a similar recommendation for, and receive several books that are just as suited to your tastes.
